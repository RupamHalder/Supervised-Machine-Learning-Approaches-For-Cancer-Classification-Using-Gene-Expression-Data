1. We selected top 20 features from a data set using PEARSONâ€™S CORRELATION feature selection algorithm for the classification. 
2. Then split the data set as training and testing data in different ratios (i.e. 1:1, 7:3, 4:1) 
then applied different ML algorithms (i.e. Logistic Regression, SVM, NB, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest Classifier) to create different models for each split.
3. We did this for each given datasets and made a report of performances.
